# Workflow aided by Gulp or Grunt

**Assignment**

+ Using the selected task runner, create your own workflow that will make everyday front-end development work easier.
+ Create a watch task, which will allow you to track changes in selected files and, for example, compile SASS to CSS, add prefixes (e.g. -webkit-) or refresh the view in the browser.
+ Additionally, create a build task that will allow you to edit and merge multiple JavaScript files into one, and thanks to this, create a production version of the application.
+ Tip: it's best to get to know both of the presented tools, but if you have time only for one thing, start with Gulp, because it's easier in mastering and nowadays more popular.
