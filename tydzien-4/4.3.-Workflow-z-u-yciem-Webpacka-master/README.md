# Workflow aided by Webpack 2

**Assignment**

+ Configure Webpack so that you it will transpile all **ES6** features to **ES5**.
+ Separate ES6 modules should be bundled into 1 file containing only ES5 code.
+ The code in the modules can be minimal. The essence is that each module contains some simple functionality and exports it.
+ The bundle should contain minified code.
+ It should be finally loaded in the **index.html** file with the &lt;script src = ""&gt; reference.

ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES:

+ You can configure the tool to compile the imported **SASS** code to **CSS** or run a server using **webpack-dev-server**.
+ Individual tasks can be made available as **npm scripts**.
