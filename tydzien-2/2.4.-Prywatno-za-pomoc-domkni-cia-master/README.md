# Private variables using closures

**Assignment**

+ Finish writing the code prepared at __http://pastebin.com/aNKyCt3N__ so that it does not generate errors.
+ Create the get and set methods without using prototypes.
+ The createData function should return an object that will contain the get and set methods.
+ The get method should accept a key, e.g. "name" and return a value, e.g. data["name"].
+ The set method should accept the key and value, check whether both of these parameters were given, and then it should set e.g. data["name"] = "Mike".
