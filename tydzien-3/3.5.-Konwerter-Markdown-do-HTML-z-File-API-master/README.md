# Markdown-to-HTML converter using HTML5 File API

**Assignment**

+ Create an &lt;input&gt; of type  "file", using which the user will be able to select a file with the Markdown format.
+ The content of the file should be automatically converted to HTML code (you can use [Showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)).
+ The HTML code that you get after using the appropriate method from Showdown.js, should be displayed in a preview field.
+ You can also add the option to copy generated HTML code. The easiest way to do this is using a &lt;textarea&gt; element and calling the .select() method on it.
