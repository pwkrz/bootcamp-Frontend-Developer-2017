# Dynamic bindings and events

**Assignment**

+ Using event bindings **(mouseenter)** and **(mouseleave)** and **[style ...]**, **[ngStyle]** or **[ngClass]** bindings, implement a hover effect on table rows making their content change color and changing the text size to 130%.
+ Additionally, try highlighting the text with the color defined in the *color* column.
+ Answer the question:

##When is it better to use ngClass and put styles in a CSS file, and when the best option is to use ngStyle?

ngStyle is useful when the value of a style is not known before the page is loaded (e.g. has to be calculated based on user input)
