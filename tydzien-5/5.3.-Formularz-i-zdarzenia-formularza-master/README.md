# Form and form events

+ Edit the playlist form using ngModel. Try wrapping all playlist input fields in a &lt;form&gt; element.
+ Angular should display an error referencing missing field names. Repair the error based on what the error message in the console says.
+ If the form starts working, add submit event support to the form, the same way you added other events.
+ If you added the event correctly, both clicking the save button and pressing Enter within any field should execute
the method attached to the submit event of the form.
